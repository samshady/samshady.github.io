### Pick a name

What do you want to call your blog?

The name can be anything you like, it can be a pun, or maybe a made up word, remember, **anything can become famous**. Apple, Google, Microsoft - These names sound familiar now, but nobody knew them once long ago.

**Remember:** Don't **overthink** this step.

You just want to get started so think for a name and move on. 

Done? Let's get cracking.
