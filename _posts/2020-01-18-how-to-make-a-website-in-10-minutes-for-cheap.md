Have you ever asked yourself *"Hey, I wonder if I can actually make money on the internet"*?  

I bet you have. It's easy, the answer is yes.  **Yes you can earn money on the internet**. But how?

The internet is a very big place and there's a lot going on, all the time. With almost 5 billion people online, **there's a high demand for content.** 

People want things to read, watch and listen.  And that is an opportunity **for you** to make money. 

**Starting a blog in 2020 is easy.** 

You don't need any programming experience, or to spend a lot of money. **In under 2 hours**, you can have a beautiful blog up and running. Is it worth your time?

# How much you can earn

Successful bloggers earn a lot of money. 

* [Pat Flynn](https://www.smartpassiveincome.com/) earns millions every year from his blog Smart Passive Income.

* [Thomas Frank](https://collegeinfogeek.com/) started Collegeinfogeek in college and paid off all his loans in a few months.
* [Neil Patel](https://neilpatel.com/blog/) got honored by President Obama and the UN and earns millions every year.

It's easy to look at these people and think you'll never get to their level. But that is the wrong way of approaching blogging. **Do not think like that.**

**Everybody starts small**. The real secret lies in the strategies and methods they used to get where they are.

It can be a bit overwhelming and confusing. In simple words,

**You need to make content that will attract people to your website. This is the golden rule.**

If you think you can write about something, anything, you can be a blogger and earn money for it. 1000$ per month is relatively easy for a blog if you use the right tools and produce good content. 

All that said, let's get to the first step to getting there.

# Before you start

## Think of a topic

**What do you want to write about?** It can be about anything.  Travel, school, technology, K-pop, you name it.

It's a LOT easier if you choose something you already know a little about.

Are you interested in a topic and are you willing to learn more later as you continue your blog? Good. Choose that.

Doing this will prevent you from running out of ideas for your blog. This step is very important and will probably take you the most time. 

So please, sit down and think for a minute. Need help? Here's some popular categories.

Done? Lets's move on to the next step.

## Pick a name

What do you want to call your blog?

*When you're thinking about this, you're already making the first creative decision for your blog. Congratulations.*

The name can be anything you like, it can be a pun, or maybe a made-up word, remember, **anything can become famous**. Apple, Google, Microsoft - These names sound familiar now, but nobody knew about them before they got big.

**Remember:** Do **NOT** overthink this step.

Some tips:

* Choose .com for your website's name. It's much easier to grasp than .org, .website etc.
* If you want it to be a personal blog, name it after yourself: first name + last name + .com or use a nickname if your name is already taken.
* Most common names will already be taken by someone else. This is usual. Get creative and make it something unique and catchy. 
* Use 2-3 words at most. No hyphens or numbers if you can help it. No one will remember CuteKittySocksMan-Thanksbro27918.com
* Pick a name and move on. The most important thing is to get started.

If you've made it this far, take a break, relax your shoulders and be proud, the hardest part of starting a new blog is now behind you!

The next steps are much easier, you'll just be following instructions.

**If you get stuck at any point during the process, come back here and read the steps again carefully. If something is still wrong, please leave me a comment below.** We're going to do this together!

Cool? Okay, time to disco.

# Making the blog

## STEP 0: Get the Ingredients

You need two things to put your blog on the internet where everyone can see it. What are they?

1. **Domain name** - this is the name of your website. Like this website is yesnobuybuy.com.
2. **Hosting** - The thing that will put your website on the internet. 

**Domain name and hosting go together**. You need **both** for a website.  

**\*\***This is the only place where you should spend money on your website. There is no need for any extra expenses as a beginner**.\*\***

**[Bluehost](https://www.bluehost.com/track/yesnobuybuy/)** is the #1 recommended place to get your domain and hosting. It's the biggest name in the game and they host over 2 million websites. 

Both the millionaires in our list above - Pat Flynn and Neil Patel recommend [Bluehost](https://www.bluehost.com/track/yesnobuybuy/). 

Usually a new domain name costs around 10$ per year and hosting can start from 10$ per month.

Bluehost's plans start at [3$](https://www.bluehost.com/track/yesnobuybuy/) per month AND **they give you the domain name for free for the first year** if you get hosting with them. 

They also give you free credit, almost 175$ to spend on Google and Bing ads. **This is a very good deal**. 

## **STEP 1: Register website name and get Hosting**

[Go to Bluehost](https://www.bluehost.com/track/yesnobuybuy/). **Click the big green "Get Started" button.** 

![Clicking the Get Started button on Bluehost homepage](/assets/img/uploads/get started.png "Get Started")

Now let's **choose the "Basic" hosting plan**. This is all we need to start our blog. If your blog becomes very successful, it's easy to upgrade to a better plan and get the extra features. But for now, click on "Select"

![Choosing the Basic hosting plan](/assets/img/uploads/select basic plan.png "Choose the Basic Hosting plan.")

Now we get to this screen. **Enter the name of your new blog and click next**. Remember to choose .com.

![Creating a new domain in bluehost](/assets/img/uploads/new domain.png "Type in your new blog's name")

If the name you want is available, you'll be taken to this next page below. If not, make some changes. Try a new name until you see this.

![Domain name is available screen in Bluehost](/assets/img/uploads/domain name is available.png "Domain name is available confirmation")

After you've filled out your personal details, select your Account Plan and  **uncheck all boxes in the "Package Extras" section.** 

**Tip**: The first extra option: "Domain Privacy + Protection" hides your personal information from others who want to see who your website belongs to. This is useful because sometimes spammers like to find new registrations and may send you spam emails. **You may leave this option checked or you can uncheck it now and add it later if you need it.**

![Choosing Account Plan and Package Extras in Bluehost](/assets/img/uploads/extra options.png "Choosing Account plan and Package Extras")

Put your payment information in carefully and make sure to **check the two boxes on the bottom**.

![Payment confirmation and Terms and Conditions Bluehost](/assets/img/uploads/payment confirmation.png "Confirming Bluehost's Terms and Policies")

Now **click the big green "Submit" button** and wait for the payment to go through. If all goes right, you should see this screen next.

![Successful payment processing Bluehost](/assets/img/uploads/congrats.png "Payment Successful")

Now **create your password** and log in to your account.

Also, **check your email**. Bluehost sends you an email to verify your new registration.

## STEP 2: INSTALL WORDPRESS

Now that we have a brand new website on the internet, it's time to go behind the scenes and start making some stuff.

To write things and put them on your blog, we will use **Wordpress**. This is a **free** website builder that is the #1 tool used by bloggers to add content to their websites.

**Bluehost automatically installs it for you**. Thanks Bluehost. 

After logging in, you see this. **Select any theme** for now. We can change this later.

![Choose a theme screen in Bluehost](/assets/img/uploads/choosing a theme.png "Choosing a theme during Wordpress Installation")

Done? Now Wordpress is automatically installed. Like so.

![Bluehost automatic installation of Wordpress](/assets/img/uploads/Setting Up wordpress.png "Wordpress is auto installed by Bluehost")

If your Wordpress installation was successful, skip the steps below and head to the next section.

If, however, you DON'T see this screen or if it gets stuck or just keeps loading, **don't panic!**

**[Sign in](https://my.bluehost.com/cgi-bin/cplogin)** to your account again and **Click on Marketplace** on the left. Then click on **Add Website.**

![Adding a website in Marketplace in Bluehost](/assets/img/uploads/adding a new website.png "Adding a Website Manually.")

**Enter the name for your site and a cool Tagline.**

![Adding Site Name and Tagline during manual website addition in Bluehost Marketplace](/assets/img/uploads/manual website creation.png "Adding a Site Name and Tagline")

**Choose the new domain name you registered.** ("nameofyourblog.com") and **click the blue box "Next"**

![Assign Domain to new manually added website in Bluehost](/assets/img/uploads/choose domain.png "Adding the domain name")

## STEP 3: OPTIMISE WORDPRESS

There's a few things we should do once Wordpress is installed to improve the performace, appearance and security of our newly setup blog.

### SECURITY

Whenever you open a website on a broswer, you will usually see a symbol of a lock just before the name of the website. 

![SSL Certificate Symbol in title](/assets/img/uploads/ssl cert(1).png "SSL Certificate")

We need to add this to our own blog so that all activites on our blog remain secure. It also makes your readers comfortable knowing it's a safe website.

Click on **My Sites** on the left of your Bluehost main panel, then click **Manage Site**.

![Managing Site on Bluehost panel](/assets/img/uploads/manage site buehost.png "Entering Manage Site settings Bluehost")

Head to **Security** and **Turn On the Free SSL Certificate**.
