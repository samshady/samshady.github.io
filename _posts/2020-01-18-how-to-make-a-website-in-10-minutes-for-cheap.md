Have you ever asked yourself:

> *"Hey, I wonder if I can actually make money on the internet"?*  

I bet you have. It's easy, the answer is yes.  **Yes you can earn money on the internet**. But how?

The internet is a very big place and there's a lot going on, all the time. With almost 5 billion people online, **there's a high demand for content.** 

People want things to read, watch and listen.  And that is an opportunity **for you** to make money. 

### **Starting a blog in 2020 is easy.**

*You don't need any programming experience, or to spend a lot of money.* 

**In under 2 hours**, you can have a beautiful blog up and running. 

# How much you can earn

Successful bloggers earn a lot of money. 

* [Pat Flynn](https://www.smartpassiveincome.com/) earns millions every year from his blog Smart Passive Income.  

![Smart Passive Income Blog Income Report](/assets/img/uploads/SPI income.png "Pat Flynn's Blog makes a ton of money")

* [Thomas Frank](https://collegeinfogeek.com/) started Collegeinfogeek in college and paid off all his loans in a few months.
* [Neil Patel](https://neilpatel.com/blog/) got honored by President Obama and the UN and earns millions every year.

It's easy to look at these people and think you'll never get to their level. But that is the wrong way of approaching blogging. **Do not think like that.**

**Everybody starts small**. The real secret lies in working smart and applying the right strategies and methods to make your website profitable.

For a beginner, it can all be a bit overwhelming and confusing. In simple words,

**You need to make content that will attract people to your website. This is the golden rule.**

If you think you can write about something, *anything*, then you too can be a blogger and earn money for it. 

1000$ per month is **easy** for a blog if you use the right tools and produce good content. 

In this post, we'll look at exactly what to do to get started. 

# Before you start

## Think of a topic for your blog

**What do you want to write about?** It can be about anything.  Travel, school, technology, K-pop, politics or maybe make-up?

It's a LOT easier if you choose a topic that you already know a little about.

You can also choose something that interests you and makes you want to learn more about it. This way, you will not run out of ideas when you're producing content for your blog.

This step is very important and will probably take you the most time. It's a good idea to take your time and think about this carefully before you move on. 

Need help? Here's some popular blog categories. 

![](/assets/img/uploads/popularblogcategories (1).png)

Done? Yay! Lets's move on to the next step.

## Pick a name

What do you want to call your blog?

*When you're thinking about this, you're already making the first creative decision for your blog. Congratulations.*

The name can be anything you like, it can be a pun, or maybe a made-up word, remember, **anything can become famous**. Apple, Google, Microsoft - These names sound familiar now, but nobody knew about them before they got big.

**Remember:** Do **NOT** overthink this step.

Some tips:

* Choose .com for your website's name. It's much easier to grasp than .org, .website etc.
* If you want it to be a personal blog, name it after yourself: first name + last name + .com or use a nickname if your name is already taken.
* Most common names will already be taken by someone else. This is usual. Get creative and make it something unique and catchy. 
* Use 2-3 words at most. No hyphens or numbers if you can help it. No one will remember CuteKittySocksMan-Thanksbro27918.com
* Pick a name and move on. The most important thing is to get started.

If you've made it this far, take a break, relax your shoulders and be proud, the hardest part of starting a new blog is now behind you!

The next steps are much easier, you'll just be following instructions.

**If you get stuck at any point during the process, come back here and read the steps again carefully. If something is still wrong, please leave me a comment below.** We're going to do this together!

Cool? Okay, time to disco.

# Make the blog

## STEP 0: GET THE INGREDIENTS

You need two things to put your blog on the internet where everyone can see it. What are they?

1. **Domain name** - this is the name of your website. Like this website is yesnobuybuy.com.
2. **Hosting** - The thing that will put your website on the internet. 

**Domain name and hosting go together**. You need **both** for a website.  

*This is the only place where you should spend money on your website. There is no need for any extra expenses as a beginner.*

**[Bluehost](https://www.bluehost.com/track/yesnobuybuy/)** is the #1 recommended place to get your domain and hosting. It's the biggest name in the game and they host over 2 million websites. 

Both the millionaires in our list above - Pat Flynn and Neil Patel recommend [Bluehost](https://www.bluehost.com/track/yesnobuybuy/). 

Usually a new domain name costs around 10$ per year and hosting can start from 10$ per month.

Bluehost's plans start at [3$](https://www.bluehost.com/track/yesnobuybuy/) per month AND **they give you the domain name for free for the first year** if you get hosting with them. 

They also give you free credit, almost 175$ to spend on Google and Bing ads. **This is a very good deal**. 

## **STEP 1: REGISTER DOMAIN NAME AND GET HOSTING**

[Go to Bluehost](https://www.bluehost.com/track/yesnobuybuy/). **Click the big green "Get Started" button.** 

![Clicking the Get Started button on Bluehost homepage](/assets/img/uploads/get started.png "Get Started")

Now let's **choose the "Basic" hosting plan**. This is all we need to start our blog. If your blog becomes very successful, it's easy to upgrade to a better plan and get the extra features. But for now, click on "Select"

![Choosing the Basic hosting plan](/assets/img/uploads/select basic plan.png "Choose the Basic Hosting plan.")

Now we get to this screen. **Enter the name of your new blog and click next**. Remember to choose .com.

![Creating a new domain in bluehost](/assets/img/uploads/new domain.png "Type in your new blog's name")

If the name you want is available, you'll be taken to this next page below. If not, make some changes. Try a new name until you see this.

![Domain name is available screen in Bluehost](/assets/img/uploads/domain name is available.png "Domain name is available confirmation")

After you've filled out your personal details, select your Account Plan and  **uncheck all boxes in the "Package Extras" section.** 

**Tip**: The first extra option: "Domain Privacy + Protection" hides your personal information from others who want to see who your website belongs to. This is useful because sometimes spammers like to find new registrations and may send you spam emails. **You may leave this option checked or you can uncheck it now and add it later if you need it.**

![Choosing Account Plan and Package Extras in Bluehost](/assets/img/uploads/extra options.png "Choosing Account plan and Package Extras")

Put your payment information in carefully and make sure to **check the two boxes on the bottom**.

![Payment confirmation and Terms and Conditions Bluehost](/assets/img/uploads/payment confirmation.png "Confirming Bluehost's Terms and Policies")

Now **click the big green "Submit" button** and wait for the payment to go through. If all goes right, you should see this screen next.

![Successful payment processing Bluehost](/assets/img/uploads/congrats.png "Payment Successful")

Now **create your password** and log in to your account.

(Also, **check your email**. Bluehost sends you an email to verify your new registration.)

## STEP 2: INSTALL WORDPRESS

Now that we have a brand new website on the internet, it's time to go behind the scenes and start making some stuff.

To write things and put them on your blog, we will use **Wordpress**. This is a **free** website builder that is the #1 tool used by bloggers to add content to their websites.

**Bluehost automatically installs it for you**. Thanks Bluehost. 

After creating a password, click **Login**. Select a theme if you want but it's best to **scroll down** and click "**Skip this step"**. We will add a theme later.

![Choose a theme screen in Bluehost](/assets/img/uploads/choosing a theme.png "Choosing a theme during Wordpress Installation")

Done? Now WordPress is **automatically installed**. Once done, click **Start Building**.

![Bluehost automatic installation of Wordpress](/assets/img/uploads/Setting Up wordpress.png "Wordpress is auto installed by Bluehost")

If your Wordpress installation was successful, skip the next couple steps below and head to the Optimize section.

*If, however, you **DON'T** see the above screen or if it gets stuck or just keeps loading, don't panic!*

**[Sign in](https://my.bluehost.com/cgi-bin/cplogin)** to your Bluehost account again and click on **Marketplace** on the left. Then click on **Add Website.**

![Adding a website in Marketplace in Bluehost](/assets/img/uploads/adding a new website.png "Adding a Website Manually.")

Enter the name for your website and a nice Tagline.

![Adding Site Name and Tagline during manual website addition in Bluehost Marketplace](/assets/img/uploads/manual website creation.png "Adding a Site Name and Tagline")

**Choose the new domain name you registered** ("nameofyourblog.com") and click **Next.**

![Assign Domain to new manually added website in Bluehost](/assets/img/uploads/choose domain.png "Adding the domain name")

## STEP 3: OPTIMIZE WORDPRESS

There's a few things we should do once Wordpress is installed to improve the performance, appearance and security of our newly setup blog.

### ENHANCE SECURITY

Whenever you open a website on a browser, you will usually see a symbol of a lock just before the name of the website. 

![SSL Certificate Symbol in title](/assets/img/uploads/ssl cert(1).png "SSL Certificate")

We need to add this to our own blog so that all activities on our blog remain secure and theres no risk of any information being stolen. It also makes your readers comfortable knowing that they are on a safe website.

Click on **My Sites** on the left of your Bluehost main panel, then click **Manage Site**.

![Managing Site on Bluehost panel](/assets/img/uploads/manage site buehost.png "Entering Manage Site settings Bluehost")

Head to **Security** and **Turn On the Free SSL Certificate**.

![Turning on the Free SSL Certificate by Bluehost](/assets/img/uploads/Free SSL Cert Bluehost.png "Turn On Free SSL")

This will take sometime to activate. After about an hour, go [here](https://www.sslshopper.com/ssl-checker.html) and put in your website's name to check if the SSL certificate is active. Look for a line saying "The certificate was issued by \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_"

### GET A THEME

![Adding a theme to WordPress](/assets/img/uploads/add a theme banner.png "Wordpress Themes")

Wordpress has an **ENDLESS** collection of themes. Using a theme lets you instantly style your website without ever needing to code or draw anything yourself. 

You can also tweak the themes to customize them and make them look like how you want them.

Here are some recommendations:

**[Verbosa](https://wordpress.org/themes/verbosa/)**

![Verbosa Theme Demo post ](/assets/img/uploads/verbosa.png "Verbosa Theme")

Verbosa is a highly customizable free theme. It's easy to learn, pretty to look at and simply, one of the best of all time.

**[Olsen Light](https://wordpress.org/themes/olsen-light/)**

![Olsen Light theme Preview](/assets/img/uploads/Olsen Light.png "Olsen Light")

Stunningly beautiful theme. Easy to customise and looks great on all devices. Highly recommended.

**[Writee](https://wordpress.org/themes/writee/)**

![Writee Theme Preview](/assets/img/uploads/writee theme(1).png "Writee Theme")

Clean, modern, stylish. What's really cool is that it has a bunch of different layout styles for you to choose from. Writee is an easy recommendation.

**[Hueman](https://wordpress.org/themes/hueman/)**

![Hueman Theme Preview](/assets/img/uploads/hueman theme.png "Hueman Theme")

If you like a content heavy design, hueman may suit your needs. It's bright, bold and smooth. Give it a try.

Find more themes here:

* [Official Wordpress themes collection](http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/): The largest source for themes. All in one place.
* [Theme Forest](https://themeforest.net/): The most popular place to buy a theme. Insane collection.
* [Divi](https://www.elegantthemes.com/gallery/divi/): This is a paid theme that is probably one of the most flexible and customisable themes ever made. It costs a lot and I don't recommend it for you as a beginner but the option is there.

### INSTALL THE THEME

Wherever you find the theme you like, Download it to your computer. It will most likely be downloaded as a **.zip** file.

From your main Bluehost screen, click **My Sites** and **Log in to WordPress**.

![Logging in to WordPress in Bluehost](/assets/img/uploads/log into wordpress.png "Log into WordPress")

Now we see the WordPress Dashboard. This is where all the magic happens. Take it in for a second.

![WordPress Dashboard Overview.](/assets/img/uploads/wordpress home.png "Wordpress Dashboard")

Click on **Appearance** on the left menu and click **Themes**. Now click on **Add New** near the top of the screen.

![Adding a new theme in Wordpress Bluehost](/assets/img/uploads/add new theme(1).png "Adding a new WordPress theme")

Now click on **Upload Theme** in the same place.

![Upload a theme in WordPress in Bluehost](/assets/img/uploads/Upload theme.png "Upload Theme option in WordPress")

Now click **Choose File**, select the downloaded .zip file for the theme from earlier on your computer and click **Install Now**.

![Installing new theme in WordPress](/assets/img/uploads/upload the new theme.png "Install the new theme")

Now go back to **Themes** on the left menu, find the new theme and click **Activate**.

Once your new theme is activated, click on **Customize** and go through the options. You can tweak this till it looks exactly like how you like it.

### ADD USEFUL PLUGINS

WordPress lets you add **plugins** to your website. These are little programs that provide extra features and functionality. They can be very useful and in some cases, **absolutely essential.**

Adding plugins is incredibly simple. You don't have to download a .zip file like for themes. 

Click on **Plugins** on the left menu of the dashboard. **Search for a plugin** and then once you find it, click **Install Now**, wait for it to install and then click **Activate**.

![Adding New Plugins in Wordpress](/assets/img/uploads/install plugins(1).png "Plugins Screen")

Here are some absolutely **essential** plugins:

* **[Yeost SEO](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/) -** SEO is the process of making your website easy to find in search engines like Google. This is **very** important because you won't make any money from your blog if nobody ever finds it. Install this plugin and use this guide [here ](https://neilpatel.com/blog/setup-yoast-seo-wordpress-correctly/)to set it up.
* **[WP Super Cache](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/) -** Caches data and allows your website to load up a lot faster.
* **[UpdraftPlus Backups](https://wordpress.org/plugins/updraftplus/) -** Free website backup tool that lets you regularly backup your blog and send it to Dropbox, Google Drive etc. Super useful.
* **[ShortPixel Image Optimizer](https://wordpress.org/plugins/shortpixel-image-optimiser/) -** Automatically scales and compresses your images so that they load faster and use less data. Awesome.

### REMOVE USELESS PLUGINS

Wordpress comes with a few plugins already installed. 

While we can just ignore these, it's recommended to only keep what you really use and remove other unwanted plugins.

Click **Plugins** then **Installed plugins** on the left

![Editing the installed plugins in WordPress](/assets/img/uploads/removing plugins.png "Installed plugins screen Wordpress")

Click on the box next to all plugins you did not install, including **Jetpack by WordPress.com**, **MOJO Marketplace**, and **OptinMonster API.** 

*Leave **Akismet Anti-Spam** untouched, it's a useful plugin.*

![selecting useless plugins](/assets/img/uploads/select plugins.png "Selecting unwanted plugins")

Click on **Bulk Actions** and select **Deactivate.** Click on **Apply.**

![Deactivating pre-installed plugins](/assets/img/uploads/deactivate and delete.png "Deactivating Pre-installed plugins")

Select all plugins (except what you installed and Akismet) by clicking the boxes next to their names. Click on **Bulk Actions**, select **Delete** and click **Apply**. 

### CHANGE PERMALINK STRUCTURE

When you create a new post, lets say, "How to boil an egg", the link to that post should be "nameofyourblog.com/how-to-boil-an-egg". This is called a permalink.

But Wordpress by default just uses a number instead of the post's title like "nameofyourblog.com/?p=231".

This is not just ugly and confusing but it also hurts your SEO which means your blog will be harder to find on Google. To change this,

Click **Settings** on the left and then **Permalinks**. Then choose **Post name** and save changes.

![Changing permalink structure on WordPress](/assets/img/uploads/permalinks settings.png "Changing Permalink option in WordPress")

# MONETIZE YOUR BLOG

![Monetisation Section Banner](/assets/img/uploads/monetize(2).png "Monetizing the blog")

Now that your blog is up and ready, it's time to see how you can monetize it and earn money.

The best monetization methods are: 

* Selling space for advertisements.
* Getting commisions for promoting and selling other people's products.
* Selling your own products and services.

### Selling Advertisements

This is the easiest option. You basically sign up with an online ad agency that will place ads on your website.

### The number of people that visit your blog is called "Traffic"

**This method depends 100% on your website's traffic.**

[Click here to see how to add **Google Analytics** to your blog which will let you track your blog's traffic for free.](https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-install-google-analytics-in-wordpress/)

If you have a blog that draws a large audience, you have **high traffic** and with that, you get **paid more** for advertisements.

Blogs and websites with a ton of traffic every month make **millions** just from advertisements. 

![Google Adsense Revenue Report](/assets/img/uploads/google adsense.png "Google Adsense Income")

Therefore it implies that adding advertisements *before* creating an audience for your blog is **useless**.

So how do you increase traffic to your blog and create an audience? 

* **Create high quality content** that is actually useful to people and create it often.

  When you make a new blog, it simply does not have enough content for people to find any value in it. It will also be impossible to show up on Google search results.

  You will have to steadily grow your blog with well written, meaningful content to become successful as a blogger.
* **Connect with your readers** on social media or in the comments section of your blog. 

  Reply to their comments and be helpful if they have questions. This will increase reader loyalty, meaning they will come back to your blog more often.
* Use **SEO** techniques to make your posts show up higher on google search results when people search for something. [Here's an excellent free guide](https://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo). 
* Use good **titles** and **tags** for each post. This is useful for search engines to recognize what your blog and your posts are about and show it to other people.
* **Guest Post** on other people's blogs. Writing posts for other blogs can bring in audience from that blog to yours if they liked what you said there..
* Select your best posts and share them to social media outlets like Reddit, Facebook etc.
* Use high quality images in your posts. This keeps readers engaged and they will stay for longer on your blog. But don't go overboard, only use images when it's useful to show something you want. 
* Tell your friends and family about the blog.
* Put the URL of your blog in your resume or personal website. This makes it easy for people to find your work right away.

If you think your blog has enough depth, you can then add advertisements to your blog.

The best way to do this is by signing up for **Google Adsense** by [submitting an application here](https://www.google.com/adsense/signup/new/lead).

### Commissions from Affiliate Marketing

Affiliate marketing is when companies and brands pay **you** for promoting **their** products.

 It's incredible because all you're doing is recommending things to your readers, and getting paid for it.

* Sign up with an affiliate program like [Amazon Associates](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/). 
* Include links to the products in your blog posts.
* Users click your links and the company pays you a small part of their sale income.
* Voila

Its easy to make a lot from just affiliate marketing but remember to follow these guidelines: 

* Only recommend things that you personally find good and useful to your readers. They are not stupid and will very quickly lose trust in you if you recommend terrible products.
* Keep your recommendations **relevant** to the theme and topic of your blog. Have a beauty blog? Recommend quality make-up items and tools. A tech review blog? Recommend your readers some great value deals and so on. 
* Make your affiliate links **clear** and easy to find. Use colorful buttons or banners that show the users where to click.
* Most importantly, **be honest** to your readers that you will make a small income if they use your links. Make it clear to them that they don't pay anything extra out of their own pockets and that you are only recommending things that you truly believe are good.

Here's an example of how Pat Flynn includes affiliate links in his blog. Look at the easy to spot buttons and the clear disclaimer under each link along with a detailed description about his reason for recommending that product.

![Pat Flynn affiliate links example ](/assets/img/uploads/affliate pat.png "Pat Flynn example ")

 It's no wonder that he makes most of his income from affiliate links. People trust what he recommends, they learn about new useful products and deals and in return he makes a good profit. Win-win.

![Amazon associates affiliate income report](/assets/img/uploads/amazon affliates.png "Amazon Associates income report")

### Selling Your Own Products

This option can be a big earner for a blog if used well. There are several things you can promote and sell on your blog

* **A small guide book or a video course**. This is a great option if you are knowledgable about a topic. 

  Do you have a food blog? A recipe book is a great option to collect and distribute your best recipes to your readers.

  A travel blog? A list of the best travel destinations or a packing list can be a useful tool for your readers. 

  Are you a voice coach or perhaps an authority on another topic? A set of video guides can help you share your information with your readers if they are willing to pay for it.

  Many bloggers also write and self-publish ebooks that they then sell to their readers. Remember, your content must always be excellent if you want people to spend their hard-earned money on it.
* **Merchandise** related to your own blog. You could design customised t-shirts or coffee cups with your logos and sell them to your community of readers. This is also a very popular option. Here's an example from linustechtips.com

![LTT Merchandise shop example](/assets/img/uploads/seeling merch.png "LTT selling their merch")
