If there's one thing you need to save in college, it's money. Let's be real for a second, the biggest priority for you when you're living in a student apartment and paying for fees, food and books, is to save wherever you can and still have the best experience you can get. If you're like me and you don't like to compromise, for only 300$, you can't go wrong with the Acer Aspire 5. Trust me.

## What Do You Need In a Laptop Anyway?

It's simple. 

* **It has to be light** - Easy to carry to classes.
* **It must be fast and powerful** - Runs everything nice and smooth.
* **Looks good and feels great** - No one wants an ugly computer.
* **Has a long battery life** - Charge only once and use the whole day.
* **Has a good screen** - Obviously.

Acer Aspire 5 has **all** of this *and* a few more extras that make it worth every. single. penny.

I was honestly surprised by how good this laptop looks. After using it for a few weeks, I really appreciated the minimal, sleek approach Acer took with this laptop. There's nothing fancy here, no gimmicks and no let downs. You get exactly what you need and that's a sentence I can just use for every section of this review. 

Let's talk some numbers.

* **Weight - 1.8 Kilograms**. Meaning? It's Light and Thin. You can pick it up with just one hand or rest it on your lap and not feel uncomfortable.
* **Screen Size - 15.6 inches.** Meaning? It's a big boy. The screen is wide and crisp. This display is **Full HD** and **IPS** which guarantees you'll have fun when watching movies or working. No complaints.
* **Speakers -** They perform well. They're on the bottom of the laptop and get relatively loud. In my experience, for watching the average Youtube video or voice calls, I had no problems hearing anything.

* **Keyboard and Touchpad -** I love this keyboard. One of the first things companies do to make budget laptops cheaper is to put in a bad keyboard with a weird layout. Not this time. The Aspire's keyboard is full sized and evenly spaced out so you don't have to cram your fingers into a tiny space. Oh and it's **backlit** too. The Touchpad is big, precise and overall they work really well together.
* **The Ports -** What's that? Basically the sides of the laptop. This is where you can plug things in and out. The Aspire has 3 USB ports, 1 HDMI port, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and ... It's enough. Like, seriously.
