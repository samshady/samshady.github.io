If there's one thing you need to save in college, it's money. Let's be real for a second, the biggest priority for you when you're living in a student apartment and paying for fees, food and books, is to save wherever you can and still have the best experience you can get. If you're like me and you don't like to compromise, for only 300$, you can't go wrong with the Acer Aspire 5.

## What Do You Need In a Laptop Anyway?

It's simple. 

* **It has to be light** - Easy to carry to classes.
* **It must be fast and powerful** - Runs everything nice and smooth.
* **Looks good and feels great** - No one wants an ugly computer.
* **Has a long battery life** - Charge it once and go the whole the day.
* **Has a good screen** - Obviously.

The Aspire 5 has **all** of this *and* a few more extras that make it worth every. single. penny. 

# Design

I was surprised by how good this laptop looks. After using it for a few weeks, I came to appreciate the minimal, sleek approach Acer went for with this laptop. There's nothing fancy here - no gimmicks and no let downs. You get exactly what you need and nothing more.

Let's talk some numbers.

* **Weight - 1.8 Kilograms**. Meaning? It's Light and Thin. You can pick it up with just one hand or rest it on your lap and not feel uncomfortable.
* **Screen Size - 15.6 inches.** Meaning? It's a big boy. The screen is wide, crisp and bright. This display is **Full HD** and **IPS** which guarantees you'll have fun when watching movies or working. No complaints.
* **Speakers -** They perform well. They're on the bottom of the laptop and get relatively loud. In my experience, for watching the average Youtube video or video calls, I had no problems hearing anything.

* **Keyboard and Touchpad -** I love this keyboard. One of the first things companies do to make budget laptops cheaper is to put in a bad keyboard with a weird layout. Not this time. The Aspire's keyboard is full sized and evenly spaced out so you don't have to cram your fingers into a tiny space. Oh and it's **backlit** too. The Touchpad is big, precise and overall they work really well together.
* **The Ports -** What's that? Basically the sides of the laptop. This is where you can plug things in and out. The Aspire has 3 USB ports, 1 HDMI port, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and ... It's enough. Like, seriously.

# Specs

Ah the specs. Everybody loves to talk specs. Gotta have all the right specs. Specs for days. Specs.

Companies and reviewers usually love to throw out complicated names and numbers and expect the average consumer to understand what it all means. **They don't**. Not because they're stupid, no. Oh no no. They just don't have the time or the need. All they want is a computer that can do everything they need it to do. 

**The Aspire does everything you need it to do.** It'll make you happy with how fast and reliable it is. 

* Do you want to have 20 tabs in Chrome open all the time? No problem. The **4 GB RAM** will take care of that.

  * What if I want like, 40 tabs? Again, no problem. Acer thought of that and left empty space for you inside the laptop to add more RAM. **You can make the 4 GB RAM into 32 GB** and have a 100 tabs open if you want.
* Do you want videos and photos and PDFs to load instantly? No problem. The **128 GB SSD** inside makes all your installed programs and stored files and also Windows to open up lightning fast.

  * What if I have like, more than a 128 GB of files. No problem. Acer thought of that too and left some empty space for you to **add an extra SSD and expand your storage capacity**. I added an additional 250 GB SSD to this laptop in under 15 minutes. It's that easy. If you want a detailed guide, leave a comment below!
* Do you want to play some games or edit and stream HD videos or do you just work a lot and don't like lags and delays? No problem. The latest **AMD Ryzen 3 processor** inside comes with integrated **Radeon Vega 3 graphics** and it will do that job for you quietly without complaining or asking you for a massage. If it does, then call a priest immediately.

  * To be noted is that the Aspire 5 also comes in more models with higher specs like a better processor, more storage, a fingerprint sensor etc. But the price also goes up accordingly and it starts to lose that value for money factor. **We only recommend the model we reviewed here for students**.
* **The battery life is great.** Usually, the thinner the laptop, the smaller the battery. That's not true for the Aspire. It has a big 4200 mAh battery that lasts almost **7 hours** on a single charge. That is just enough for one whole day of work or class. If you're going to be using it to do intensive tasks like playing games or watching videos with the brightness high, bring your charger along. It's small and cute and doesn't weigh that much. Don't be lazy. 
* That's all the specs we need to talk about. If you're curious though, check it out on Acer's website by clicking [here](https://www.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/model/NX.HG8AA.001)

# Price and Verdict

This where it gets good. This model of the Aspire 5 (A515-43-R19L) is listed for usually around **320$** on Amazon. Regular sale price is around an amazing **265$.** If it's not available in your country's Amazon or if it's too expensive there, you can ship it from the US website for only around 60$ and still get it for under 400$.  

**This is hands down the best deal you can find for a new budget laptop in the market right now**. 

If value for your money is what is important to you then the Acer Aspire 5 with its easy to upgrade specs, premium looks and quality and all round solid performance should absolutely be your choice for a budget laptop.
