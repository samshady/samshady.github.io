How do you get more done without spending a lot of money? It's simple. 

We went through a lot of advice on the internet and filtered it down to just a few **actually** worth-your-time-options for you. 

Let's get started.

# Add an extra monitor to your Laptop or Computer

The single best way to boost your productivity immediately is to add more screen space to your setup. 

More free space lets you have multiple open windows right in front of you without having to switch between them. 

The best part about this option is that it is easy and inexpensive. 

For an extra monitor, the cheapest option is to look for second hand deals on ebay, craigslist etc. There is a high chance that you will find a great deal instead of buying a brand new monitor.
