How do you get more done without spending a lot of money? It's simple. 

We went through a lot of advice on the internet and filtered it down to just a few **actually** worth-your-time-options for you. 

Let's get started.

# Add an extra monitor to your Laptop or Computer

The single best way to boost your productivity immediately is to add more screen-space to your working setup.

### More free space lets you have multiple applications right in front of you without having to switch between them.

You can, for example, have a video tutorial open on youtube in one screen and follow along in another. 

Or open up a spreadsheet in one screen as reference and write an email in the other. 

There's a reason why you'll often see two or sometimes *several* monitors being used by creators and designers in any tech company.

According to [a study done by the Jon Peddie Research](http://www.jonpeddie.com/special/MultDisp.shtml), productivity increases an average of **42%** when using multiple displays.

The best part about this option is that it is **easy and inexpensive**.

**The cheapest option** is to look for second hand deals on ebay, craigslist etc. It's not hard to find great pre-used monitors for under 50$ regularly. 

In this case, **always look for seller ratings and read the reviews. Don't forget to test out the monitor before you buy it.**

If all that is too much work and you'd rather just get a new one, here's our top budget recommendation:

*If you can't find this specific model, [just look for any monitor under a 100$ and you're all set](https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://amzn.to/2RW3vtE)!*

# Stand While Working

When we sit for long periods of time, our posture tends to get worse.

The risks of pain and stiffness in the back and joints plus increased weight and improper breathing increases.

[According to a study in 2016](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/05/160525220539.htm) standing up while working increased productivity by almost **50%** among users of standing desks in offices.

The key to this step however is to **not overdo it**. Standing up or sitting down are both bad if done for long periods of time at once. 

### Try to alternate between sitting down and standing up. Also add some light stretching and walking around for the best results.

**The easiest and free way** to achieve this is to put some books or cardboard boxes on your table and use them for extra height. 

*However if you want a less messy option, [use a standing desk with adjustable height](amzn.to/382jeg6).* 

Here's our top recommendation:

# Write Down Your Thoughts

![Einstein writing down his formulas on a blackboard](/assets/img/uploads/write-down.png "Einstein writes down his thoughts")

Writing down your ideas is a great way to clear up some space in your mind. 

Remembering and keeping everything organized in the brain is hard.

By taking out the information and organizing it on something else, we let the brain focus on other important tasks.

It lets us process that information better and faster and also create new ideas without worrying about forgetting something.

### Do this twice every day- Morning: to flush out your thoughts and get your creative juices flowing and Evening - to review your day and plan out the next.

The easiest way to do this is using the classic pen and paper method.

*We recommend this smart reusable notebook which lets you upload all your notes to Gdrive, Dropbox etc and then erase all the pages:*

**[Rocketbook Smart](https://assoc-redirect.amazon.com/g/r/https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07WFVVCLX?tag=yesnobuybuy-20)**

Or make it easier to see your plans and ideas with a classic whiteboard. This is the preferred choice in every academic institution for a reason:

# Conclusion

You don't have to spend a lot to do anything in our world, let alone be more productive. 

Being resourceful and smart about your choices will ultimately lead you to more success than expensive, unreliable options that promise a lot but do not deliver. 

Good luck!
